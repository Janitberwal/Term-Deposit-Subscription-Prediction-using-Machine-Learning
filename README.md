# Term-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on features such as age, job, marital status, past interactions, and more. This helps banks target the right customers, optimize resources, and improve campaign effectiveness.
